# GA
GA library is for the generation of musical phrases with genetic algorithms in OpenMusic. GA library is compatible with OM 7.1. At the moment it works only on MAC OSX. Anyway you can download the source code. Documentation also needs to be improved, in the meantime you can get an idea by seeing the examples. For any issues or request please concact: gvrnldr(at)aol(point)com
